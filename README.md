git clone
https://github.com/Jonahjohnzon/CJ-Mixify.git

2. ### Install dependencies:
```

3. ### Build the project:

**Front-End**
- Setting up our Environment:
   - We verify that node.js and npm are installed on our computer, and then proceed to create a React project using vite.
- Spotify Developer Account:
The session below was executed on CJ-Mixify;
   - Sign up for a Spotify developer account if you haven‚Äôt already.
- React + Vite Integration:
    - This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
      Currently, two official plugins are available:

    - [@vitejs/plugin-react uses](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) `Babel` for Fast Refresh.
    - [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses `SWC` for Fast Refresh.
    - Talwind CSS for styling.

**Back-end**
- API Development with Node.js and Express:
  - We kickstarted our project by creating a Node.js application (using npm init) and incorporating Express (via npm install express) to handle HTTP requests and construct our API endpoints. Within this framework, we meticulously defined routes for user authentication, playlist retrieval, track searches, and user data management.

- Database Integration:
  - We opted for MongoDB as our database system to manage user profiles, playlists, and track details.


# `Usage`
1. To run CJ-Mixify locally you'll need:
